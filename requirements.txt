# Core RAG System Dependencies - Step by Step Build
# We'll add these back as we implement each component

# Text processing and NLP (for embeddings when we build them)
# sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
# numpy>=1.24.3

# Vector database (when we implement proper similarity search)
# faiss-cpu>=1.7.4

# OpenAI API (when we implement the generator)
# openai>=1.3.6

# For now, we start with just basic Python - no external dependencies!
# This makes it easier to focus on understanding each component
